Explanation of the Mermaid Diagram
This diagram visualizes the primary architecture flow, then specifically highlights the critical health check propagation that enables the failover.

Primary Region (Active): This subgraph shows the active path where user traffic initially flows.

Route 53 Primary Record (R53P): Your domain's DNS entry, configured with a health check.
Public ALB (PALB): The internet-facing load balancer in the primary region.
API Gateway (APIGW_P): The regional API Gateway endpoint.
NLB - Internal (NLB_P): The Network Load Balancer inside your VPC.
Internal ALB (IALB_P): The Application Load Balancer inside your VPC.
ECS Tasks (App Logic) (ECS_P): Your containerized applications running on ECS.
The arrows indicate the flow of requests.
Secondary Region (Standby): This subgraph shows the duplicate infrastructure in the secondary region, ready to take over. It mirrors the primary region's setup.

Route 53 Secondary Record (R53S): The failover target in Route 53.
Public ALB (SALB), API Gateway (APIGW_S), NLB - Internal (NLB_S), Internal ALB (IALB_S), ECS Tasks (App Logic) (ECS_S): These are the identical components in the standby region.
Health Check Propagation: This crucial subgraph illustrates how an issue at the ECS level cascades up the chain to trigger a Route 53 failover.

ECS Tasks (/health): Your application in ECS exposes a /health endpoint. If this returns anything other than a 200 OK, it signifies a problem.
IALB Target Group Health Check: The Internal ALB's health checks continuously query the /health endpoint on your ECS tasks. If these fail, the ALB marks the ECS tasks as unhealthy.
NLB Target Group Health Check: The NLB checks the TCP listener of the Internal ALB. If the Internal ALB cannot serve traffic (because its targets are unhealthy), the NLB's health check will fail.
API Gateway VPC Link: If the NLB becomes unhealthy, API Gateway's VPC Link will fail to connect or integrate with the backend, leading to API Gateway returning errors (e.g., 5xx).
Route 53 Health Check (R53_HC_AGW): This is the ultimate health check configured in Route 53. It periodically sends a request to your API Gateway's health check endpoint (e.g., /healthcheck).
Route 53 Failover Trigger (R53_Failover): If the Route 53 Health Check detects consecutive failures from the API Gateway, it triggers the DNS failover.
Failover Action:

When the R53_Failover is triggered, Route 53 updates the DNS for your domain.
R53S (Secondary Record) becomes active, and new traffic is directed to the SALB (Secondary Public ALB).
This diagram visually demonstrates the full chain of health dependency, from the application layer up to the global DNS service, enabling resilient multi-region failover.
