You're asking specifically about how to aggregate the health status from multiple ECS service replica count checks into a single alarm that Route 53 can use for failover. This is precisely what the cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo from our previous discussion is designed to do!

You cannot directly create a single CloudWatch alarm that natively monitors RunningTaskCount for multiple distinct ECS services as a single metric. Instead, you create an individual RunningTaskCount alarm for each service, and then you aggregate the results of these individual alarms.

Here's a breakdown of how the aggregation works and how it connects to Route 53, leveraging the split repository structure we designed:

1. Individual Microservice Repos: Generating the Base Alarms
What they do: Each microservice-repo (e.g., users-service-repo, products-service-repo) is responsible for its own ECS service definition. Crucially, it also defines and manages its own aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm specifically for its RunningTaskCount metric. This alarm will go into ALARM state if that specific service's replica count drops to zero.
Key output: Each microservice repo then uses an outputs.tf file to output the alarm_name (and optionally the ARN) of its specific RunningTaskCount CloudWatch alarm.
2. The cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo: Consolidating Alarm References
What it does: This is the dedicated repository whose job is to "collect" the alarm names from all your individual microservice repositories.
How it works:
It uses multiple data "terraform_remote_state" blocks, one for each critical microservice. Each data block points to the S3 backend state file of a particular microservice repo.
It then accesses the cloudwatch_alarm_name output from each of those data blocks.
It then uses a map in its own outputs.tf to consolidate these individual alarm names into a single, structured output. For example:
Terraform

output "primary_ecs_alarm_names_map" {
  value = {
    "users_api"    = data.terraform_remote_state.users_service_state.outputs.cloudwatch_alarm_name,
    "products_api" = data.terraform_remote_state.products_service_state.outputs.cloudwatch_alarm_name,
    # ... and so on for all critical services
  }
}
Why this step is crucial: It acts as a single point of truth for all critical ECS replica count alarms, preventing the route53-repo from having to know about (and directly read from) every single microservice repo's state.
3. The route53-repo: Creating Health Checks and Aggregating for Failover
What it does: This repository consumes the consolidated alarm names from the cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo and uses them to build the Route 53 health checks.
How it works:
It uses a data "terraform_remote_state" block to read the primary_ecs_alarm_names_map output from the cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo.
It then uses a for_each loop on this map to dynamically create an aws_route53_health_check of type CLOUDWATCH_METRIC for each individual ECS service's RunningTaskCount alarm.
Terraform

resource "aws_route53_health_check" "ecs_zero_health_check_from_alarm" {
  for_each = data.terraform_remote_state.cloudwatch_alarms_aggregator.outputs.primary_ecs_alarm_names_map
  # ...
  alarm_identifier {
    name   = each.value # This is the alarm name from the map
    region = var.primary_aws_region_name
  }
  type = "CLOUDWATCH_METRIC"
  # ...
}
Finally, and this is the crucial aggregation for Route 53, it creates a single aws_route53_health_check of type CALCULATED. This calculated health check's child_healthchecks argument will include:
The Route 53 health check for your Primary ALB.
ALL the individual aws_route53_health_check resources created from the ECS RunningTaskCount alarms (using a for expression: [for hc in aws_route53_health_check.ecs_zero_health_check_from_alarm : hc.id]).
(Optionally) any Lambda-based synthetic health checks.
The child_health_threshold for this CALCULATED health check would typically be set to the total number of its child health checks (length(concat(...))), meaning if any of the critical components (ALB, any ECS service, any synthetic check) are unhealthy, the entire primary region is marked unhealthy, triggering failover.
In Summary:
The cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo acts as the central point where information about all individual service health alarms (from RunningTaskCount or other specific metrics) is gathered. The route53-repo then consumes this consolidated data and translates it into a Route 53 CALCULATED health check, which then drives your active-passive failover.

This modular approach ensures that:

Each microservice remains independent.
The Route 53 configuration is clean and dynamically includes all relevant health signals without hardcoding every microservice.
The aggregation logic is clear and contained within the cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo.
Please refer back to the code examples for the cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo and the route53-repo in the previous detailed answer, as they fully illustrate this aggregation pattern.
Yes, you're hitting on a very common and effective pattern for robust, distributed system health checks. The cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo in our existing design is exactly for this purpose.

Let's reiterate how this works to aggregate your "multi-service replica count checks" and assign them to Route 53:

1. Individual Microservice Repositories (e.g., users-service-repo, products-service-repo)
Responsibility: Each of these repos defines its own AWS ECS Service and a dedicated CloudWatch Metric Alarm for that service's RunningTaskCount.

Alarm Configuration: The alarm should typically be configured to transition to ALARM state if the RunningTaskCount drops to 0 for a sustained period (e.g., Sum of RunningTaskCount LessThanThreshold of 1 for 1 consecutive period of 1 minute).

Outputting Alarm Name: Crucially, each microservice's outputs.tf file needs to export the ARN or, more simply, the alarm_name of its RunningTaskCount CloudWatch alarm.

Terraform

# Example in users-service-repo/outputs.tf
output "users_api_running_tasks_alarm_name" {
  description = "Name of the CloudWatch alarm for Users API RunningTaskCount."
  value       = aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.users_api_running_tasks_alarm.alarm_name
}
2. cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo
Purpose: This repository acts as a central hub to gather the CloudWatch alarm names from all your individual microservice repositories. It doesn't create new alarms; it just references existing ones.

Collecting Alarms (using terraform_remote_state): It uses data "terraform_remote_state" to read the outputs from each of your microservice repos.

Terraform

# Example in cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo/main.tf

data "terraform_remote_state" "users_service_state" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-company-terraform-states" # Your S3 state bucket
    key    = "users-service/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1" # Region where users-service state is
  }
}

data "terraform_remote_state" "products_service_state" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-company-terraform-states"
    key    = "products-service/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

# ... and so on for all critical microservices
Aggregating Outputs: It then consolidates these individual alarm names into a single map as an output.

Terraform

# Example in cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo/outputs.tf

output "primary_ecs_running_tasks_alarm_names_map" {
  description = "Map of critical ECS service RunningTaskCount alarm names for the primary region."
  value = {
    "users_api_running_tasks"    = data.terraform_remote_state.users_service_state.outputs.users_api_running_tasks_alarm_name,
    "products_api_running_tasks" = data.terraform_remote_state.products_service_state.outputs.products_api_running_tasks_alarm_name,
    # Add more critical services here
  }
}
3. route53-repo
Purpose: This is where the actual aggregation for Route 53 happens. It consumes the consolidated map of alarm names and builds the Route 53 health checks.

Reading Aggregated Alarms: It uses data "terraform_remote_state" to access the output from the cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo.

Terraform

# Example in route53-repo/versions.tf (or wherever your data sources are defined)
data "terraform_remote_state" "cloudwatch_alarms_aggregator" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-company-terraform-states"
    key    = "cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1" # Region where the aggregator state is
  }
}
Creating Individual Route 53 Health Checks from Alarms: It uses a for_each loop with the map received from the aggregator to create a separate aws_route53_health_check of type CLOUDWATCH_METRIC for each of your critical ECS service replica count alarms.

Terraform

# Example in route53-repo/main.tf
resource "aws_route53_health_check" "ecs_running_tasks_health_check" {
  provider = aws.primary # Assuming you're creating this in your primary region

  for_each = data.terraform_remote_state.cloudwatch_alarms_aggregator.outputs.primary_ecs_running_tasks_alarm_names_map

  alarm_identifier {
    name   = each.value # This is the CloudWatch alarm name
    region = var.primary_aws_region_name # Your primary AWS region
  }

  type                = "CLOUDWATCH_METRIC"
  invert_health_check = false # Don't invert, if alarm is ALARM, health check is unhealthy

  tags = {
    Name        = "R53-HC-${each.key}" # e.g., "R53-HC-users_api_running_tasks"
    Environment = "Production"
    MonitorType = "ECS-Replica-Count"
  }
}
Aggregating into a "Calculated Health Check": Finally, you modify your existing primary_api_overall_health_check (which should be of type CALCULATED) to include these newly created ECS replica count health checks as children.

Terraform

# Example in route53-repo/main.tf (modifying existing resource)
resource "aws_route53_health_check" "primary_api_overall_health_check" {
  provider = aws.primary

  type = "CALCULATED"

  child_health_check_ids = concat(
    [aws_route53_health_check.primary_alb_health_check.id], # Existing ALB health check
    [for hc in aws_route53_health_check.ecs_running_tasks_health_check : hc.id], # ALL ECS replica count HCs
    [for hc in aws_route53_health_check.lambda_custom_health_check_from_alarm : hc.id] # Any Lambda-based synthetic HCs
  )

  # The crucial part: if ANY child health check is unhealthy, the parent becomes unhealthy.
  # Setting this to 'length(child_health_check_ids)' means ALL must be healthy.
  # If you wanted N-1 resiliency, you'd set this to length - 1.
  child_health_threshold = length(aws_route53_health_check.primary_api_overall_health_check.child_health_check_ids)

  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.api_subdomain_prefix}-${var.your_main_domain_name}-Overall-API-HC"
    Environment = "Production"
    Region      = "Primary"
  }
}
Workflow and Execution Order:
Deploy/Update Microservice Repos: Each microservice team runs terraform apply for their repo. This ensures their ECS service is running and their RunningTaskCount CloudWatch alarm exists and its name is in their remote state.
Deploy/Update cloudwatch-alarm-aggregator-repo: After critical microservices are deployed, run terraform apply for this repo. It will read the alarm names from the microservice states and output the consolidated map to its own remote state.
Deploy/Update route53-repo: Finally, run terraform apply for the route53-repo. It will consume the consolidated map, create the individual Route 53 health checks, and update the overall calculated health check to include them.
This design effectively aggregates the health of individual ECS services (based on replica count) into a single, comprehensive health signal for your primary region, enabling Route 53 to trigger failover if any critical service experiences a replica count drop.
