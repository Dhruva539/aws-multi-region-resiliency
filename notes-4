Why ALB as the Route 53 Health Check Point?
Abstraction: The ALB provides a stable, highly available endpoint for your service. The individual Fargate tasks behind it can come and go (due to scaling, deployments, failures) without directly impacting the Route 53 health check.
Layer 7 Health Checks: ALBs perform sophisticated Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) health checks on your Fargate tasks within their target groups. They understand HTTP response codes, paths, and host headers. Route 53 can then monitor the ALB's health, which in turn reflects the health of your underlying Fargate services.

Regional Focus: Route 53's primary role in this setup is to direct traffic to the healthy region. The ALB in each region is the "gateway" to that region's services. If the ALB itself (or its configured health checks to Fargate) indicates an issue, Route 53 should fail over.
Simplicity: Directly pointing Route 53 to individual Fargate task IPs would be complex and fragile due to Fargate's dynamic IP assignment and short-lived nature.
How it Fits into Your Multi-Region Resiliency (Refined Architecture)
Let's revisit your architecture and highlight how the ECS Fargate ALB becomes the effective Route 53 health check point:

Layer 1: Route 53 (DNS Layer)

Routing Policy: Failover Routing with associated health checks.
Health Check Target: The public DNS name of the ALB in the corresponding region (from Layer 2).
Route 53 performs HTTP/HTTPS health checks on this public ALB DNS name.
Crucial Point: Route 53 will consider the ALB healthy if it receives a 2xx/3xx response from the specified path. This implies that your ALB's target group health check (to your Fargate tasks) must be correctly configured, and the Fargate tasks must respond to that health check path.
Layer 2: ALB -> Private API Gateway (via VPC Endpoint) / Or direct to ECS Fargate

Public-Facing ALB in each region:
This is the endpoint that Route 53 directly monitors.
It has an HTTP/HTTPS listener.
Health Check Configuration for ALB Target Group: This is the internal health check from the ALB to its targets.
If your ALB is directly in front of Fargate (common for web apps): The ALB's target group would point to your ECS Fargate service, and the health check path (/ping, /healthz, etc.) would be on your Fargate container.
In your specific proposed architecture (ALB -> Private API Gateway -> NLB -> Internal ALB -> Fargate):
The public ALB (Layer 2) still needs a health check that ultimately reflects the health of your entire service chain. This is why your documentation correctly mentions:
Path: /ping (or a similar health check endpoint exposed by the API Gateway or a mock endpoint that eventually reaches a healthy Fargate task).
Host Header: Your API Gateway custom domain, e.g., api.example.com.
The idea is that if anything in the chain (API Gateway, NLB, Internal ALB, or Fargate itself) fails, the public ALB's health check to its target (the API Gateway VPC Endpoint) will fail, causing the public ALB to be considered unhealthy by Route 53.
Detailed Health Check Flow:
Route 53 Health Check:

Route 53 sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to my-api-alb-primary-123.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com (the public ALB DNS name).
It sends these requests on the specified path (e.g., /ping) and port (e.g., 443).
It expects a 2xx or 3xx HTTP response code.
Crucially, Evaluate Target Health = true on the Route 53 record means Route 53 will also consider the health of the ALB's own target groups.
Public ALB's Target Group Health Check (Layer 2):

The public ALB continuously sends health checks to its targets (in your case, the IP addresses of the Private API Gateway VPC Endpoint ENIs).
These health checks use the /ping path and api.example.com host header.
If the API Gateway, or any service behind it (NLB, Internal ALB, Fargate tasks), fails to respond correctly to this health check path, the Public ALB marks the VPC Endpoint ENI as unhealthy.
API Gateway, NLB, Internal ALB, Fargate Health Checks (Layers 3, 4, 5):

API Gateway: Integrations from API Gateway to NLB/VPC Link can be configured to respond to health checks.
NLB: The NLB's target group (pointing to the Internal ALB) has its own TCP health checks.
Internal ALB: The internal ALB (Layer 4) has target groups for each of your Fargate microservices. These target groups perform their own HTTP/HTTPS health checks directly against the Fargate tasks on their configured ports and paths. This is where the actual health of your Fargate application is primarily determined.
Fargate Tasks: Your container images should expose a dedicated health check endpoint (e.g., /health, /status, /ping) that returns a 200 OK only when the application is fully ready and functional, including any critical internal dependencies (like database connections).
Summary of How Fargate Health Impacts Route 53:

Fargate Task Health -> Internal ALB Target Group Health -> NLB Target Group Health -> Public ALB Target Group Health -> Public ALB overall health (due toevaluate_target_health=true) -> Route 53 Health Check Status -> Route 53 DNS Failover

Terraform Code Considerations:
The Terraform code you provided for Route 53 health checks is correct for this pattern. The fqdn property of the aws_route53_health_check resource should point to the public DNS name of your ALB in each region.

No direct Fargate health check in Route 53:

You will not create aws_route53_health_check resources that directly target Fargate task IPs or Fargate service names. Route 53 is too far upstream for that level of granularity and dynamism.

The key is to ensure that your Fargate services themselves have robust health checks configured within their ECS service definitions and ALB target groups. If a Fargate task becomes unhealthy, the ALB will stop sending traffic to it. If enough Fargate tasks (or the entire service) become unhealthy, the ALB's target group for that service will reflect an unhealthy state, which the public ALB's overall health check can then detect, leading to the Route 53 failover.

This layered approach ensures that Route 53 makes its failover decisions based on the overall health and availability of your application in a given region, as determined by the entire load balancing and service chain.
